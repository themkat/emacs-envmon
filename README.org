* envmon.el
Wanted another excuse to create some Emacs Lisp code, so making more environment monitors that integrates with my [[https://github.com/themkat/pico-environment-monitor][pico-environment-monitor]] :)

For local development (when I don't have my pico-environment-monitor available), I use a custom mockserver setup which can be found [[https://github.com/themkat/AmiEnvMon/tree/main/utils][here (in the AmiEnvMon repo)]].


** Requirements
envmon.el depend on:
- [[https://github.com/alphapapa/plz.el][plz.el]]: For fetching data from API and getting the result as an associative list.
- [[https://github.com/magit/magit/blob/main/lisp/magit-section.el][magit-section]]: To create magit like Emacs GUI


It also requires that [[https://github.com/themkat/pico-environment-monitor][pico-environment-monitor]] is running.

** Usage
Configuration options:
- =envmon-url=: this should be configured to be the base URL or IP that your environment monitor is running on.


After making sure these are configured properly, you can simply run =M-x envmon= and the buffer with the data will show. (like the screenshot above).
